### Tasks:
- Dentismo aims to solve all of these problems by providing residents of Gothenburg (users) seeking dentist services, and dentists and clinics providing these services with a web application that brings them together. This means users will be able to pick out the clinic most suitable for them in terms of time and location, and request an appointment with that clinic during any free time slot, and dentists will be able to respond to their appointments by either denying or approving them.
